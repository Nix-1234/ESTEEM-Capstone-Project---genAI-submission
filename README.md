## Project Overview
Ascend Career Hub is a comprehensive healthcare workforce platform designed to solve the problem of internal mobility friction. By creating a unified "Passport" for clinical staff and an intelligent "Nudge Engine," it helps healthcare systems retain their best talent by making career advancement visible, accessible, and supported.

## How to Run the Project
1. Open the project folder in your terminal.
2. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
3. The project is a React-based web application. Use a standard local server or host on platforms like Vercel/Netlify.
4. For development: `npm install` and then `npm start` (if using a standard CRA/Vite template) or simply open the entry HTML if using a CDN-based approach as configured.

## The AI Intelligence Layer
The core differentiator of this platform is the **AI Connective Tissue**.

### What the AI Does
- **Task**: Evaluates user competencies against institutional needs to drive retention.
- **Inputs**: User certifications, shadow history, unit view counts, and tuition benefit status.
- **Outputs**: Proactive "Nudges" (Job matches, expiring benefits, milestone encouragement) and manager-side "Intent Signals."

### Why AI was Chosen
Conventional job boards are passive. Healthcare workers are too busy to search for their next step. AI was chosen to act as a **proactive career coach**, pushing the right opportunity to the right user at the right time.

### Improving the Product's Goal
The goal is to reduce turnover. By alerting a manager when a high-intent internal candidate (who has shadowed their unit) exists, the AI prevents that candidate from looking outside the health system. It turns a "staffing problem" for the manager into a "success story" for the employee.
